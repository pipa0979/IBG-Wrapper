 Welcome to GERMLINE, a tool for detecting long segments shared
 by descent between pairs of individuals in near-linear time.

 For more details, please see the paper [ PMID: 18971310 ]
 or the web-site [ http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~gusev/germline/ ]

 GERMLINE was coded by Alexander Gusev and collaborators in 
 Itsik Pe'er's Computational Biology Lab at Columbia University
